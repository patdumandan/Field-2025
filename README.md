**TEMPNET: Temperature-dependent networks**


This is a repository containing data and code that were collected and prepared by the TEMPNET team during the summer of 2025 in Greenland.

**TEMPNET** is a project aimed at characterizing the temperature-dependence of ecological interaction networks, with a focus on Arctic systems. It is divided into two main parts, aiming to understand how insects behave and interact under different temperature conditions in Arctic environments. 
In the first part (WP1), we focus on quantifying the temperature-dependence of individual taxa by conducting temperature performance assays. We collect response data under controlled conditions in the lab, measure relevant behaviors such as movement and feeding, and determine the temperature range in which each species can survive and remain active.
In the second part (WP2), we test how integrating taxon-specific thermal performance improves our predictions on species interactions. We conduct mesocosm experiments, in which simplified interaction networks (i.e. plants and pollinators) are subjected to different thermal conditions.
